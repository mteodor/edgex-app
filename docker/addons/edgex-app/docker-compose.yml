###
# This docker-compose file contains optional InfluxDB-reader service for the Mainflux
# platform. Since this service is optional, this file is dependent on the docker-compose.yml
# file from <project_root>/docker/. In order to run InfluxDB-reader service, core services,
# as well as the network from the core composition, should be already running.
