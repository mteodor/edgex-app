Mainflux is modern, scalable, secure open source and patent-free IoT cloud platform written in Go.

It accepts user, device, and application connections over various network protocols (i.e. HTTP,
MQTT, WebSocket, CoAP), thus making a seamless bridge between them. It is used as the IoT middleware
for building complex IoT solutions.

For more details, check out the [official documentation][docs].

Mainflux is member of the [Linux Foundation][lf] and an active contributor
to the [EdgeX Foundry][edgex] project. It has been made with :heart: by [Mainflux company][company],
which maintains the project and offers professional services around it.

## Features
- Multi-protocol connectivity and protocol bridging (HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket and CoAP)
- Device management and provisioning
- Fine-grained access control
- Storage support (Cassandra, InfluxDB and MongoDB)
- Platform logging and instrumentation support
- Event sourcing
- Container-based deployment using [Docker][docker] and [Kubernetes][kubernetes]
- [LoRaWAN][lora] network integration
- SDK
- CLI
- Small memory footprint and fast execution
- Domain-driven design architecture, high-quality code and test coverage

## Install
Before proceeding, install the following prerequisites:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once everything is installed, execute the following commands from project root:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

This will bring up all Mainflux dockers and inter-connect them in the composition.

```
make cli
./build/mainflux-cli version
```

> Mainflux CLI can also be downloaded as a tarball from [offical release page][rel]
